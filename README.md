#  Arithmetic in COBOL
This documentation is intended for people who understand the basics of the COBOL language.
You can clone this project and use it as a sample in your COBOL environment.
In this program, we will use basic arithmetic operations, such as: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Besides, we use the compute instruction, which takes two variables and tells it what type of operation we will perform.
